          It's going to be pugs Sunday this week! Pugs are small dogs with big personalities.
          They live to love and to be loved and were bred for one reason: to be your companion.
          They will try to live in your lap, eat your food, and sleep on your bed.
          They are incredibly playful, outgoing, adaptable, happy, lively, and affectionate.
          They need human companionship to survive, and will not do well at all if left alone for long periods of time.

          Corgies are so cute! The Cardigan Welsh Corgi equals big personality in a little dog.
          These are intelligent, active, alert little guys who will want to be the center of your world.
          They love to be with their families, and will shower you with loyalty, devotion and affection.
          They need daily exercise and love to take long walks with you.
          They are intelligent and eager to please and do great with obedience training.
          They excel in obedience, agility, flyball, Frisbee, herding, and tracking competitions.
          They get along very well with respectful children, but parents need to be aware that Corgis might try to herd kids.
          (They also might try to herd other animals and your houseguests.) Most Corgis like to be with other cats and dogs.
          They are adaptable dogs and can live anywhere as long as they get walked, but they do like to bark, so close neighbors might object.
          While personalities differ within the breed, in general, the Corgi is even-tempered, hardy, friendly, loyal and loving. And they are always full of fun.
